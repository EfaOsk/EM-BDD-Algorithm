# EM-BDD Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains the complete source code for the EM-BDD (Expectation-Maximization learning with Binary Decision Diagrams) algorithm developed for learning Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The EM-BDD algorithm leverages Binary Decision Diagrams to optimize the learning process, offering a alternative to traditional methods such as the Baum-Welch algorithm.
